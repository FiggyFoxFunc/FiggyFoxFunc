# 👋 Hi, I’m Figgy
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things; languages of all forms, philosophy, science, reading, cute critters and more. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. Improving at Python and LISPs and other languages. I have begun exploring languages such as Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun projects, in particular language creation, OSdev and more.
- 📫 Pop a message to me on <a rel="me" href="https://tech.lgbt/@FoxFunction">Mastodon</a>.
